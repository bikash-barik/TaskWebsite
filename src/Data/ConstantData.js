      "Srila Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of ISKCON, wanted devotees to gain a systematic understanding of the profound Vedic philosophy that he presented through his books. This site is a humble attempt from ISKCON Ghaziabad to facilitate devotees in fulfilling this instruction of Srila Prabhupada by means of courses.",
    paragraph2:
      "It is certainly worthwhile knowing how to control the mind. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that the mind can be controlled by constant “practice and detachment.”(—Bhagavad Gita, 6.35). He says that wherever and whenever the mind wanders, due to its flickering and unsteady nature, we must bring it back under the control of the Self (—Bhagavad Gita, 6.26).",
    paragraph3:
      "In a similar way the intelligence and the spiritual being that we are must control the mind. The mind is attracted to so many material things and everywhere we look, someone is telling us that if just have one material thing or another then we will be happy…but it always proves to be false.",
    paragraph4:
      "So the adults, the teenagers and even sometimes children they had cigarettes smoking, had cigarettes hanging from their mouths in the same fashion. And some years later, he died of cancer of the lip and the lung. But by the time he died, everyone was so addicted that they couldn’t give it up. The power of habit completely covers over our logic, our intelligence and our pursuit of well-being and happiness; cancer is a horrible miserable cause of death.",
    paragraph5:
